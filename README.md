# DraftJS for Formik 

This is a drop-in implementation of DraftJS. It assumes base-level functionality, mainly text formatting without embedding, linking and other advanced features. As a styled component, you can easily modify the UI to fit your project. To customize further, I suggest looking at Jared's example from Formik: https://codesandbox.io/s/QW1rqjBLl. 

Coming soon.
